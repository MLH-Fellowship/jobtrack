# JobTrack
A web application to track and manage job applications over time.

## Problem
When searching for work, we usually send many job applications to different companies. One can lose track of which applications was sent where and at which stage the job application is currently at for different companies. People also lose track of what version of their CVs or Motivational letters were sent as part of the application. It makes sense to have a Job Application Tracker which keeps a record of where you are in the job hunt process for all the companies which interest you.

## Solution
We built this web application to be able to track which companies you are applying to and at what stage in the process you are currently on. This will make it easy for people to organize their job hunting process. In the near future, we might make it possible to use ML and other toold to source for jobs online and recommend to people based on their skill sets.
